Camera trap data is one method used to track the wildlife in geographic regions. Data from urban areas can inform researchers about the distribution of wildlife populations as well as population patterns over time. Moreover, comparison of data between multiple cities provides insight into how urban wildlife varies over time. The current method for animal detection in camera trap images is through manual detection and classification, which is a time consuming and expensive process. A proposed method to improve the speed and accuracy of data processing is through a pipeline that can be used by multiple teams across different habitats and therefore varying species. The proposed pipeline uses a Machine Learning (ML) model to detect and classify animals in camera trap images. We explore various ML models for object detection to identify the most accurate method. This pipeline offers an efficient way to load and process data to reduce data processing time. Additionally, it allows for standardized data that can be used for cross team collaboration and evaluation. We compare our results to a multi-city dataset that was previously tagged by human computation. We discuss our results in the context of alternative approaches to machine learning with wildlife image classification.
